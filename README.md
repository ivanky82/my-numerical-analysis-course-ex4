# my-numerical-analysis-course-ex4
Created matlab/octave codes to be used in Lab 4 of numerical analysis course. However, this is still in Indonesian language.  This exercise is about numerical methods to solve large system of linear equations using Gaussian Elimination and using LU factorization.
The file ex4.m is the main file of this exercise. It contains information on how to do this exercise.
